NAME 		:	TAPAS ROY
DATE		:	02/06/2021

DESCRIPTION	:	Program to find which day of the year, given the number from 1 to 365
			
			â€¢Suppose, in a week let us assume first day is 'Sunday', then second day
			 will be 'Monday' and so on. If first day is 'Monday' then the second day
			 will be 'Tuesday' and so on.
		
INPUT 		:	Positive integer say 'N'. Where 1 <= 'N' <= 365. 
			1 <= Starting day <= 7
			Option to set the first day.
			
OUTPUT 		: 	Enter the value of 'n' : 9
			Choose First Day :
			  1. Sunday
			  2. Monday
			  3. Tuesday

			  5. Thursday
			  6. Friday
			  7. Saturday
			Enter the option to set the first day : 2
			The 9 th day is Tuesday
			
			Do you want to continue(y/Y): y
			Enter the value of 'n' : 9
			(Menu to be displayed)
			Enter the option to set the first day : 8
			Error : Invalid input first day should be > 0 and <= 7
			
			Do you want to continue(y/Y): y
			Enter the value of 'n' : 0
			Error : Invalid Input, n value should be > 0 and <= 365
			
			Do you want to continue(y/Y): y
			Enter the value of 'n' : 366
			Error : Invalid Input, n value should be > 0 and <= 365
